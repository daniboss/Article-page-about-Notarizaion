                    <p>A notary is a representative chosen by the state government who is authorized to draft or certify a specific action or deed. Contracts, legal papers used in foreign countries, and deeds could all fall under this category.
                        Being a fair-minded observer in various affirmations is a requirement for the notary function. A notary's duties might include anything from merely signing a record of a property transaction to more significant deeds and paperwork.Notarization is an official fraud prevention process that guarantees the parties to a transaction that the document is genuine and can be trusted. The blockchain allows keeping records in such a way that they cannot be edited or deleted.
                        A Blockchain-based notarisation has the ability to notarise any kind of digital content by creating a unique hash (fingerprint) of any digital document format and to store this hash in a distributed and decentralized ledger.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h1 class="l-heading">A Digital Solution To Notary Activities</h1>
                        <div id="element12"></div>
                        <p>An official has the option to do the notarizing process electronically thanks to an electronic (digital) notary. For the certification of certificates, notaries public have had the ability to use technology like digital signatures and notary seals for a long time. The certified document is endowed with the approved seal and signature by the electronic notary. The digital certificate is created, managed, stored, and distributed during this notary public activity using cryptography and a protected public key. In the case of the digital notary a current, electronic register for the notarial duties completed must be kept. A digital solution to notary public activities can also be performed remotely.

                            <h1 class="l-heading">How Blockchain Technology Can Be Used For Digital Notary Services</h1>
                            <div id="element13"></div>
                        <p>The notarization procedure is anticipated to be facilitated by blockchain technology. Users can be sure that the data on the chain is accurate thanks to this technology. Blockchain already has the potential to greatly enhance notary powers given its well-known qualities. Users are guaranteed tamper resistance and non-repudiation. 
                        </p>
                            
                            <h1 class="l-heading">Types Of Notary Services Provided By Blockchain</h1>
                            <div id="element14"></div>
                        <p>There are three areas of notary services that can be altered by the deployment of blockchain technology.These supplied services cannot immediately replace notary services, as specified by the law (at least, not yet); they can only enhance the overall process. From nation to country, they may be either approved or refused. Highlighted below are the areas where blockchain technology can help with notary public services.
                        </p>
                           
                            <h1 class="l-heading">Proof Of Existence</h1>
                        <p>The core of notarial work is the capacity to vouch for existence. Blockchain technology is designed to perform this task with ease and can save the document itself..Through the use of timestamps, any alterations to such a document may be quickly and easily identified. Two steps are involved in this:
                        </p>
                        <h1 class="l-heading">1. Hashing the document:</h1>
                        <p>In direct substitution of posting the certified document on the blockchain, it is more practicable to upload the hashed copy of the certified document. Hashes are smaller in size and therefore a more efficient option to store documents on a blockchain.Every time a document is changed, the cryptographic hash will change. As the block hash contains the document data, the blockchain can be used to verify the document by validating the integrity of the blockchain.
                        </p>
                        <div id="element15"></div>
                        <h1 class="l-heading">2. Storage on the blockchain</h1>
                        <p>The hash value is then recorded on the blockchain.</p>
                        <h1 class="l-heading">Proof Of Ownership</h1>
                        <div id="element16"></div>
                        <p>Blockchain offers proof of ownership with each transactional movement of an asset by its very nature. For the establishment of evidence of ownership, several notary services need the formation of a user account. The database stores the transaction ID and any other kind of identification. Typically, the user account is located outside of the blockchain. This slightly affects the confidence level of the notary service even if some component of the authenticating service is on the blockchain. Only the document's hash is added to the proof of ownership system. A provided transaction ID fetches the record from the storage. The retrieved data draws upon the hashed documents for integrity checks. Before releasing the document, the user identification area confirms who owns it. Additionally, contract capacity may be provided via smart contracts, which is helpful in enhancing some flexibility in the design of the entire program.
                        </p>
                            <h1 class="l-heading">Document Ownership Transfer</h1>
                            <div id="element17"></div>
                        <p>In circumstances when transfer of ownership is necessary, the ownership of such a document is determined either through an external user account or certificate authority system. The ownership database is kept on the stored data on the delimited blocks of the blockchain. It's as easy to transfer ownership as altering any record:

                            <br>• User identity is noted in pertinent transactional sections and is utilized for validation.<br/>
                            <br>• Through transaction identification verification, a signature is established for the user in the data field.<br/>
                            <br>• When deploying contracts, the blockchain offers hash verification and signature storage.<br/>
                            Simply said, The transfer of ownership of papers and deeds on the blockchain is as simple as the transfer of funds between several traditional banks.</p>
                            <h1 class="l-heading">Benefits Of Using Blockchain Technology For Notary Public Services</h1>
                            <div id="element17.5"></div>
                        <p>Blockchain technology is known for its reliability and speed. Using the blockchain to provide notary public services has many advantages:

                            <br>• The safety of deposited papers and deeds.<br/>
                            <br>• Access to the documents with a private key.<br/>
                            <br>• Secured storage on the blocks with suitable timestamps.<br/>
                            <br>• Easy ownership transfer of documents via the network.<br/>
                            <br>• Open transactions on the network for the verification procedure.</p>
